    <div class="intro">The City of Joy is one of the hotspots of the universally famed Indian cuisine, simply because of all the culinary influences that have converged here over the centuries. Being a coastal city, there was never a shortage of seafood and it has always been a staple here. But, then when the Mughals arrived and brought with them the delight of spices, the game of Kolkata food was upped. Followed by the British who made it their seat of power for a good two centuries, during when they further diversified the taste of Kolkata. Somewhere during that time, the Chinese immigrants arrived and really revolutionized the Indian food scene with their flavours. The first taste of Indo-Chinese food was the gift of Kolkata to the rest of the country, and it has evolved into a fully developed international cuisine unto its own since then<BR><BR>
        Here’s the list of the most popular restaurants and some hidden food gems in Kolkata that are a must-visit to sample the best of food offered in the city.<hr>

            <p class="text">About: marbella's is this quaint, pretty-looking cafe that's sure to give you spain-like feels. Inspired by the owner nikhil chawla's travels to europe, the decor is colourful, minimal and fuss-free. Ever seen a coconut tree inside a washroom? No, right? Well, there is one inside the toilet to retain that connect with nature at the cafe,.there is also a mango tree right in the middle of this garage-turned-cafe just to keep intact those natural elements. The space is divided into three zones - first is the al-fresco setting for sun-kissed mornings with a lot of natural light coming in, second is the 'isoulation' section if privacy is what you seek or wish to work while enjoying a cup of freshly-brewed coffee and the last one is the indoor section done up in soothing colours and pretty lights.</br>
